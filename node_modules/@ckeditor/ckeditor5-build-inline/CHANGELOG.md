## [11.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/compare/v10.1.0...v11.0.0) (2018-07-18)

### Release notes

This is a major releases that introduces many smaller features, dozens of bug fixes and a couple of infrastructure changes (an upgrade to `webpack@4`, simplified structure of the build repository). Additionally, the `InlineEditor#element` property was renamed to `InlineEditor#sourceElement` and the `InlineEditor#updateElement()` method was renamed to `InlineEditor#updateSourceElement()`.

If you maintain a [custom build of CKEditor 5](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html) or [integrate CKEditor 5 from source](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup.html#scenario-2-building-from-source), we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136).
